# Final Project – CSCI 3202: Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

This project is a final submission for the CSCI 3202 course, focusing on key areas in Artificial Intelligence using Python and the AIMA codebase. It includes original implementations, experiments, and analysis of various AI paradigms such as:

- Game playing agents
- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)
- Classical planning
- Supervised learning
- Logical reasoning

The centerpiece of the project is the `Final_Project_Hanville_Gavin.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates custom work and integrates with AIMA Python utilities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the AIMA repo (if not already included):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python.git
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install essentials:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `Final_Project_Hanville_Gavin.ipynb` to explore the custom AI implementations.
